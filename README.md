Simple JS game

First, we use a program called "tiled" to create our EnemyEntity2 which is located in the .tmx file. My badGuy2.png is located with the rest of the files on here. Then the assignment states the following:

Add a second enemy entity named EnemyEntity2 with the following properties and behaviors.

Design your own 16 x 16 image and name him badGuy2.
Add this enemy to the game, giving him the ability to "remove" collected coins from the player, rather than killing him or her, upon collision.
Some of the game areas affected or needed are

New Object layer for map in Tiled;
EnemyEntity2;
entityPool object;
gameOver object;
entities.js file; and
resources.js file.
